CAD Files and Drawings are seperated by title. Most of these are personal projects, however, some of these are school related or done for a job. The drawings folder is divided into three categories based on complexity & difficulty of the object. There is also a section for solar car related stuff. There are some .txt files that contain a little information about the project.
